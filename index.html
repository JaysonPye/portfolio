    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="container about-container">
        <p>
            I'm a full-stack web developer based in Tokyo, currently working at
            <strong>KidsUP</strong>, where I help modernize and maintain
            internal systems across dozens of schools. My work mainly involves
            <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>, integrating
            services like S3, CloudFront, and RDS to keep apps fast, secure, and
            reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began coding in <strong>2020</strong> while studying at
            <strong>RMIT University</strong>, and later joined KidsUP as an
            English teacher. I soon rebuilt the company’s photo-sharing platform
            using <strong>React</strong>, turning it into a modern, monetized
            product used by thousands of customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I’ve focused on creating scalable, maintainable systems
            with clean code and thoughtful UX. I’m now looking to join a
            collaborative engineering team where I can contribute to
            production-grade applications and continue growing as a developer.

                        company that I currently maintain. Together we began
                        developing vision-up.app, and when he moved on, I took
                        over full development. Through that experience, I
                        learned TDD, read a few textbooks on rails and realized
                        I enjoy the omakase nature of the framework. Now I
                        develop and maintain many production level applications
                        based on Rails. Full-stack development with emphasis on
                        clean models, performant views, and automation.

                        I learned JS at uni, then continued that by creating
                        some production-grade React apps with Node backends. My
                        Rails development also relies heavily on JavaScript via
                        Hotwire and Stimulus. I’m comfortable working across
                        both modern component-based front-ends and progressively
                        enhanced server-driven UIs.

                        After our tech lead left, I had to step up fast and
                        learn the ins and outs of AWS to keep our systems
                        running smoothly. That experience gave me a strong grasp
                        of how to set up, deploy, and maintain production-ready
                        infrastructure. I’ve since handled CI/CD pipelines,
                        environment configuration, and zero-downtime releases
                        across staging and production. I’m comfortable digging
                        into logs, resource metrics, and deployment errors to
                        keep things stable.

                        structures and algorithms, which later made it easier to
                        pick up new languages and to think about performance and
                        architecture in production.

                        A modern photo management and sales platform for parents
                        to view and purchase photos of their children’s school
                        events. Rebuilt from scratch to replace a slow, unstable
                        legacy system. Handles
                        <strong>thousands of customers per event</strong> and
                        integrates with Google Drive to aggregate and serve
                        event photos with thumbnail generation, caching, and
                        access control. Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for
                        scalable and reliable performance.
