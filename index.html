    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="container about-container">
        <p>
            I'm a full-stack web developer based in Tokyo, currently working at
            <strong>KidsUP</strong>, where I help modernize and maintain
            internal systems across dozens of schools. My work mainly involves
            <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>, integrating
            services like S3, CloudFront, and RDS to keep apps fast, secure, and
            reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began coding in <strong>2020</strong> while studying at
            <strong>RMIT University</strong>, and later joined KidsUP as an
            English teacher. I soon rebuilt the company’s photo-sharing platform
            using <strong>React</strong>, turning it into a modern, monetized
            product used by thousands of customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I’ve focused on creating scalable, maintainable systems
            with clean code and thoughtful UX. I’m now looking to join a
            collaborative engineering team where I can contribute to
            production-grade applications and continue growing as a developer.
